My name is Scott McCann "Mac Canna" (Gealic: son of wolf)
I am from Kingsville, Tx. My family moved to kilkenny Ireland in 1994 we moved back to the states in 1998
I play guitar, like to make pixel art, and I know a little bit of Irish Gaelic.
I've always wanted to make games, learning how to code, and getting my foot in the door of the industry is the first step.
